## The Problem - Non Customizable "New Tab" Pages 
New tab pages are cool. You know, the ones which pop with all the "Good Evening Akhil" and the time and all that when you open a new tab? 
So instead of simply installing a Firefox/Chrome/whatever browser addon (which sucks because you can't really customize it) I decided to create a backend and host my own damn new tab page :sunglasses:  

## The Solution - A simple backend to host custom new tab pages
This repo contains a simple NodeJS server which simply puts static pages onto the localhost. All you have to do is redirect the new tab link to your local host after setting up the server. 

Play with static files all you want and voila, super cool customizable new tab pages ;)
